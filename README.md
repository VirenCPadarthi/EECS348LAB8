Matrix Operations:

This project includes matrix operations in C++ like reading matrices from a file,  matrix addition,multiplication,diagonal sum, row and column swaps, and updates.

Files"

- main.cpp: The main file that contains the program logic.
- matrix.cpp: Contains functions to perform matrix operations.
- matrix.hpp: Header file for matrix operations.

Features:

1. Read Matrices from File: Load two N x N matrices from a file.
2. Matrix Addition: Add two matrices.
3. Matrix Multiplication: Multiply two matrices.
4. Sum of Diagonal Elements: Calculate the sum of the main and secondary diagonals.
5. Row Swap: Swap two rows of a matrix.
6. Column Swap: Swap two columns of a matrix.
7. Update Matrix Element: Update a specific element of a matrix.

Later, Just compiled the code and uploaded the required files to the repository.
